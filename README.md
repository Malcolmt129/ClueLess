## Current things to know

    This is the first iteration of the project. As we all know, we are trying to 
    find the best of two options. So for the time being there are two branches set 
    up for 2 different scenarios that we are trying to implement. There is the pygame 
    implementation and the flask implementation. So be careful of which one you 
    contribute. Create your own branches and remember which implementation you intend 
    to add to. 


## Python Environment

    I have set up a python virtual environment. This is so that we can manage all of 
    the dependencies between us easily. If you arent spun up on what a virtual 
    environment is or how to run it, I will find some resources and put them in the 
    README. For now, it is important that we understand that the virtual environment 
    should be active any timethat you want to run code in the repo. 

### How to activate venv

    Enter this command:
    ``` source venv/bin/activate ```


    You will know that the virtual environment is active when you see (venv) in the 
    front of your current working directory in the terminal. I will do research to 
    see if it's different for windows. If you want to make it so that everyone is on 
    a Unix type system, you can also set up a WSL2 on Windows. Just let me know if 
    you need help with that.t
